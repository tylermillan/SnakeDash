For the last week, it was all implementation. We initially started working with pthreads and also solidified our use of ncurses and printing to a new window. We had some difficulty getting pthreads working so we made a switch to using C++11 built in threads which we tested on IX, which worked nicely. We also made a big shift in our game as felt that the standard snake game has been heavily overdone and we wanted to do something more original. So we decided that we wanted to a create a game still utilizes a snakehead and eating food, but with a lot of twists. We added difficulty levels as well as timers based on user input and board size, respectively. We accomplished this by utilizing four threads, one for user input, one for dropping traps on the board, one for dropping food on the board, and the another one as the timer. All four of these threads are joined together which allows us to update and print the board while still listeneing to user input on the getUserInput thread which has a blocking call from getch(). All in all, we are really happy with our switch and especially glad that we had the opportunity to learn a lot about threads, which is something that we have not touched since 212.
