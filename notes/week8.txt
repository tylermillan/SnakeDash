This week was spent finalizing our design patterns and getting a really good start on creating the board. We also spent a lot of time talking about additional features that we are gong to add such as difficulty levels which will range from easy, medium to hard. These levels will be dictated by how far away the food is as well as the speed of the game. One of the biggest issues that we need to figure out going forward is how to get user character input which will dictate the direction of the snake in an asuynchronous way(i.e. without the user having to press enter). A couple potential solutions that we will look into include the conio.h header file as well as the ncurses library. We will check in with Professor Norris early this week to get her recommendation and will continue forward.
