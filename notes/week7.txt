	The focus of this weeks was mainly focused on creating the head of the snake in 
the game. It alsi involved creating the food aspect of the game which spawns food at a
random location on the board which acts as the target for the user. This involved 
meeting for 4 hours and discussing how we were going to go about implementing this.
We decided on using the rand function for generating which spot on the board the food 
is placed. This then keeps score of how many food have already been eaten. 
	Implementing the head of the snake involved being able to move it up, down, left, 
and right. This is done by waiting for the users input. When this occurs the position
the space on the board is updated with the current object, which in this would be the 
head of the snake. This will eventually lead to the rest of the snakes body to trail 
this head object.
