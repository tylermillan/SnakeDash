	The focus of this weeks was mainly focused on establishing the board for the 
 game to be played on. This involved meeting for 4 hours and discussing how we were 
 going to about displaying the snake and previously described board. This led to an
 initial roadblock of deciding whether to use a static or dynamically allocated array 
 to represent our game board. We ended up deciding on a dynamically allocated array 
 as we wanted to give users the ability to choose between three different sizes of 
 board. A large(16x16), medium(12x12), small(8x8) board options which the user enters 
 when prompted. 

  	We also planned how we wanted to break down the project into specific classes and 
 functions. Which led to another roadblock of defining what would be contained in our 
 board class and what would be contained in our snake class.
