For this week, we followed up with Professor Norris about ncurses which we went ahead and used. We implemented our board to use the getch() function from ncurses which will allow us to get character input in real time and be able to change the direction of the snake. We also spent a lot of time learning how to initialize and use the ncurses data structure. We also spent a lot of time going over design considerations such as implementing another 2d char array for the snake or utilizing a dictionary. We ultimately deciced that those additional data structures added little additional functionality and that just utilizing the board with the snake in it would be a cleaner implementation. Going forward we will work on getting the movement down and the logic to detect if the snake is out of bounds.
